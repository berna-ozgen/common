# Common Project
This is the project that I extracted from my Rent A Car Microservice project and uploaded to the Maven repository. You can go to the link below to get the dependency extension for Common and paste it into your project's pom.xml file.

> What's in the common repository?

- The events I used in the microservice project
- The card information I created for the payment service
- The utilities folder that contains exceptions, mapping, and results

#### I kept the common files in this package and used it in my microservice project with a dependency.
